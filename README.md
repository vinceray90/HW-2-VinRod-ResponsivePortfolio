# HW-2-VinRod-ResponsivePortfolio

In this assignment I was tasked with creating a responsive portfolio about myself with a **Contact**, **Portfolio**, and **About Me** page. In order to accomplish this I did the following:
- I first created three separate .html files called *contact.html*, *index.html*, and *portfolio.html*.
- The three files were given a basic DOCTYPE html template and all were linked to bootstrap within the *head* element.
- A nav bar was created in with functional links to each of the three webpages, and "hamburgers" in response to the pages size manipulation. A sticky footer which displays "@ COPYRIGHT Vince Rodriguez" was also applied and follows the page when scrolling.
- I used the boostrap "Card" in order to contain each pages contents without the need of a *container* element.
- The **contact.html** contains a functional form with an *email*, *message*, and *name* fields.
- The **index.html** file contains a profile picture as well as a Bio description of your's truly.
- The **portfolio.html** file contains 5 responsive images that adjust in response to the manipulation of the page's size as required. 
- Various comments were added throughout the files to display what was altered from the original bootstrap syntax.
- Routinely added, committed, and pushed updates to GitHub.
